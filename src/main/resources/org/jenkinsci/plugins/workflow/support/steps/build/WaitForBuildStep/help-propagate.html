<p>
    If enabled, then the result of this step is that of the downstream build being waited on (e.g.,
    success, unstable, failure, not built, or aborted).
    If disabled (default state), then this step succeeds even if the downstream build is unstable, failed, etc.;
    use the <code>result</code> property of the return value as needed.
